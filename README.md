# An LLM chatbot for helping diagnose skin issues

## How to use

1. Upload an image of your skin issue (optional)
2. Describe the issue in as much detail as possible. See below for a question template.

### A common question template could be:

Category 1: The Basics (History of the Condition)

First, let's establish the timeline and location.

    Where on your body is this located? (e.g., face, chest, back, shoulders, upper arms, thighs?)

    How long have you had these spots? Are we talking days, weeks, months, or have they been a recurring issue for years?

    Did they all appear at once, or did they develop gradually?

    Is the condition constant, or does it seem to flare up and then get better? (i.e., does it come and go?)

Category 2: Symptoms (How It Feels)

Now, let's talk about any physical sensations associated with it.

    Are the spots itchy? If so, how intense is the itch on a scale of 1 to 10?

    Are they painful or tender to the touch?

    Do you ever experience a burning or stinging sensation in the area?

    If you run your hand over the area, what is the texture like? Does it feel rough, like sandpaper, or are they distinct bumps?

Category 3: Your Personal & Medical History

Your overall health and history provide crucial clues.

    What is your age?

    Have you ever had a similar rash or condition before?

    Do you have any known skin conditions like acne, eczema, rosacea, or keratosis pilaris? Is there a family history of any of these?

    Are you taking any new medications, vitamins, or supplements (including protein powders or pre-workouts)?

    For female patients: Do you notice any relationship between the flare-ups and your menstrual cycle?

Category 4: Lifestyle & Potential Triggers

Often, external factors play a significant role.

    What is your current skincare routine for this area? Please list all products you use (cleansers, moisturizers, sunscreens, body washes, lotions, oils, etc.). Have you started using any new products recently?

    Do you notice the condition gets worse after certain activities? For example:

        After working out or sweating heavily?

        After wearing tight-fitting clothing (like athletic wear)?

        After shaving, waxing, or other hair removal in the area?

    Have you noticed any link to diet, stress levels, or recent travel?

Category 5: What You've Tried

Finally, let's discuss any treatments you may have attempted.

    What have you already tried to treat this? (e.g., over-the-counter acne washes with salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide, hydrocortisone cream, exfoliating scrubs, home remedies?)

    Did anything you tried make it better?

    Did anything you tried make it worse?
